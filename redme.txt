Todo List Application
This is a simple to-do list application developed using Python's tkinter module. 
The application allows the user to create a list of tasks, select multiple tasks at once, 
add and delete tasks, and exit the application.

Instructions:

Installation
To install and run the To-do List app, simply download the code from this repository and run it in
a Python environment.
The main window of the application displays a task list and two images. The user can select
tasks from the task list by clicking on them.
To add a new task, click the "Add Task" button. This will open a new window where the user 
can enter a new task.
To delete a task, select the task from the list and click the "Delete Task" button.
To exit the application, click the "Exit" button.
Note: The application only accepts a predefined list of tasks, which are stored in
the "selected_tasks" list. If the user enters a task that is not on this list, 
a warning window will be displayed.
